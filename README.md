# 🖐️ Hand Gesture-Based Draggable Rectangles using OpenCV and cvzone

This project demonstrates an interactive system where users can **drag rectangles on screen using hand gestures** detected via webcam input. It uses **OpenCV**, **cvzone**, and **MediaPipe** (via cvzone) to track hand landmarks and enable gesture-based interaction — specifically, moving objects using the index and middle finger.

## 🔍 Features

- Real-time hand tracking with webcam
- Drag-and-drop functionality using finger gestures
- Smooth and responsive interaction
- Transparent overlay effect for modern UI appearance
- Multiple draggable rectangles


## 📦 Requirements

- Python 3.7+
- OpenCV
- cvzone
- numpy
